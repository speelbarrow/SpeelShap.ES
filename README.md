# SpeelShap.[ES](https://ecma-international.org/technical-committees/tc39/)
Make your HTML a bit more [speely](https://speely.net).

## Installation
This package lives only on GitHub. Luckily, NPM (or whatever alternative package manager you may choose to use) makes it
super easy to pull it down anyway!
```shell
npm install speelbarrow/SpeelShap.ES
```
This command will check you out on the `latest` branch, which will be updated with each release of the library.

If your workflow does not support NPM packages, you can include the static files from Github using either of the
following methods: 
- From HTML:
  ```html
  <script type="module" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speelbarrow/SpeelShap.ES/latest/dist/components/index.js"></script>
  ```
- From Javascript:
  ```javascript
  import * as speelshapes from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speelbarrow/SpeelShap.ES/latest/dist/components/index.js"
  ```
